# Task_TextGeneration_MarkovChains
# 📚 Task 03 – Text Generation using Markov Chains  
**Part of the Generative AI Internship Projects**


## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a simple **text generator** using the **Markov Chain algorithm**, a classical probabilistic approach to modeling sequential data. Unlike neural network-based language models like GPT, Markov Chains rely purely on statistical dependencies between words based on past occurrences.

The goal of this project is to understand how **word transition probabilities** can be used to generate human-like sentences from scratch using nothing but math and clever data structures.


## 🎯 Objective

To build a Python-based text generator that:
- Learns from a given text dataset (corpus).
- Constructs a transition probability dictionary (i.e., the Markov Chain).
- Generates realistic or creative text using learned patterns.

This project builds foundational knowledge for understanding language models, sequence prediction, and probabilistic text processing.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- Standard libraries:
  - `random` – for word sampling
  - `re` – for text cleaning
  - `collections` – for frequency analysis (`defaultdict`, `Counter`)
- Optional:
  - `NLTK` – for sentence or word tokenization
  - `argparse` – for CLI input of corpus and output size



## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. 📖 Training Phase
- Load the text corpus from input.txt.
- Clean the text and tokenize it into words.
- Construct a dictionary where:
  - The **key** is a word (or pair of words if using bi-grams).
  - The **value** is a list of possible next words that follow the key in the text.
- This forms a Markov Chain of word transitions.

### 2. 🧾 Generation Phase
- Randomly choose a starting word (or let the user specify).
- Use the transition dictionary to repeatedly pick the next word based on probabilities.
- Continue this loop for N number of words or until the chain breaks (i.e., no next word found).


## ▶️ How to Run

### ✅ Step 1: Clone or Download

git clone https://github.com/your-username/markov-text-generator.git
cd markov-text-generator


### ✅ Step 2: Prepare Your Dataset

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Bi-gram or Tri-gram Chains | Instead of using single-word states, use word pairs/triples to improve sentence fluency. |
| 💬 CLI Argument Support       | Let users customize output size, input corpus, or starting word via command line.        |
| 🎨 GUI                        | Add a simple Gradio or Tkinter interface for interactive use.                            |
| 📚 Dataset Preprocessing      | Use SpaCy or NLTK to tokenize accurately, remove stopwords, or segment sentences.        |
| 💾 Model Saving               | Export and reuse transition dictionaries for fast reuse without retraining.              |



## 🧪 Evaluation

While Markov Chains are not state-of-the-art in NLP today, they offer:

* Speed and simplicity
* Interpretability
* Great educational value

They **struggle with long-term dependencies**, grammar rules, and context — which modern transformers solve well. But understanding this model helps in grasping the core idea behind language modeling.



## 💼 Use Cases

Even basic Markov models can be used for:

* Random story generators
* Fake quote generation
* Auto-poetry
* Simulating old-school chatbots
* Humor generation (e.g., mixing two authors' styles)
